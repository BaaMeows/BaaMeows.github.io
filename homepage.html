<p class="main_text">Hi, i'm BaaMeows! Welcome to my website!

It's a little... sparse, right now, and I managed to break the back button, but hey! It exists! You know, mostly! No promises!

It might be updated next weekend, or never. I am a silly creature, and I do strange things at odd times.

Okay, well, goodbye forever! Good luck with your life! Remember to love as much as possible! Insert another cheesy ideal here!
